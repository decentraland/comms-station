# Welcome

The Decentraland comms demo station is an educational project, intended for developers to learn about the inner workings of the protocol.

Using the station, you'll be able to manually operate a simple but reasonably featured comms client. The UI is designed to clearly match the source code, so you can read along while you experiment with it.

### Running

The station is a web application. Install dependencies and start a web server using:

```
npm install
npx vite
```
