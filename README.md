# Welcome

The Decentraland comms demo station is an educational project, intended for developers to learn about the inner workings of the protocol.

Using the station, you'll be able to manually operate a simple but reasonably featured comms client. The UI is designed to clearly match the source code, so you can read along while you experiment with it.

### Getting Started

Use the deployed version at [[url]], or run it locally with:

```
npm install
npx vite
```

This will start a `localhost` dev server.

If you want to follow along with the source code, see [main.ts](src/main.ts).
